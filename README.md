*CHART GOES HERE*

1. Which movies have an average rating above 7? 

Justification:  

This query helps managers identify high-performing genres that consistently receive favorable audience reviews. It can inform decisions on what types of movies studios should produce more frequently. 

2. Select the names of movies where the number of tickets sold is higher than the average of movies in North America.

Justification: 

This query provides insights into which movies are outperforming in a key market (North America), helping managers focus marketing and distribution efforts. This information helps movie producers know what kind of movies they should produce if they want to appeal to this specific market.

3. Which studios have won at least 3 Academy Awards for their movies?

Justification: 

Tracking which studios have consistently won prestigious awards is valuable for partnerships and investment decisions. Only including movies that have won at least 3 times filters results to only show studios that have a proven track record of success. 

4. List movies, their release year, and their director if the movie has no awards, ordered by release year.

Justification: 

Identifying movies without awards can help managers evaluate underappreciated films for potential re-releases or marketing opportunities. These results can also lead them to understand what customers donâ€™t like to see in their movies. 

5. Which actor has appeared in the most award-winning movies? 

Justification: 

This query helps managers identify actors who consistently contribute to award-winning films, which can inform casting decisions. 

6. Which directors are the most successful based on revenue and number of movies directed?

Justification: 

Tracking the most financially successful directors helps in strategic planning for future projects and collaborations. 

7. Select the release year, number of movies produced that year, and total revenue for those movies (only for movies over 2 hours, rated above 7, released post-2009). 

Justification: 

This query helps managers analyze the performance of high-quality, long-duration movies in the past decade, allowing for data-driven future investments.

8. Which actors appear in movies with average box office revenue higher than the overall average?

Justification: 

Identifying actors associated with high-revenue films helps managers make more strategic casting choices for profitable outcomes. This query also allows management to see the exact relationship between the actors of movies and the amount of revenue the movie generates.

9. At which times do movies sell the most tickets? 

Justification: 

Knowing when movies perform best can guide theaters in scheduling showtimes to maximize sales and profit. 

10. Which genre has the most movies with a box office revenue above the average?

Justification: 

Understanding which genres consistently outperform in revenue helps guide genre focus in future productions.
